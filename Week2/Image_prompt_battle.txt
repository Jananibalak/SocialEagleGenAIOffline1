create image  1. The Opening: The Golden Orchard
Subject: An elderly indian couple with soft, simplified 3D features; the wife’s skin has subtle, painterly wrinkles and a matte texture.

Composition: A slow-dolly tracking shot that moves laterally through tangerine branches before settling on the couple.

Action: Sitting on a mossy stone wall; the wife’s steady hands peel a vibrant tangerine with fluid, weight-based 3D animation.

Location: A lush orchard at the edge of a cliff; stylized, swaying grass and soft-edged trees.

Style: Stylized 3D production with painterly surface shaders, no outlines, soft-brushed textures inspired by Flow (2024).

Aesthetics: Low-contrast golden hour; warm orange light wrapping around the edges of characters; ethereal and serene atmosphere. maintain the same ratio as per uploaded image


create image, aspect ratio as per uploaded image - The Flashback: The Shelter
Subject: The young indian couple, hair and clothes appearing damp with a matte, non-reflective "wet" shader.

Composition: A static close-up shot with the camera slightly handheld to simulate natural breathing.

Action: Huddled under a single, small, transparent umbrella; rain hits the surface in stylized, glowing white ripples.

Location: A village path with simplified, blocky architecture.

Style: Meticulously crafted 3D; rain is animated as glowing streaks rather than realistic droplets.

Aesthetics: Cool indigo and teal lighting; soft-focus background; intimate and rhythmic movement; "glow" effect on highlights.

Subject: Younger versions of the indian couple; athletic but lean builds, wearing textured, simple canvas work clothes.

Composition: A dynamic low-angle follow-shot, moving at the same pace as the characters to create a sense of shared journey.

Action: Carrying heavy, hand-painted woven baskets; their shoulders tilt realistically under the weight; they exchange a brief, tired smile.

Location: A dusty, sun-baked path through a simplified green grove.

Style: Painterly 3D with "baked" lighting; environment looks like a moving oil painting.

Aesthetics: High-summer heat haze; vibrant green and earthy brown color palette; tactile and organic textures.

Subject: The elderly indian couple’s hands and faces; emphasis on the "painterly" light-wrap on their skin.

Composition: A shallow-focus over-the-shoulder shot that pulls focus from the tangerine slice to the husband's kind eyes.

Action: HUSBAND HOLDS THE TANGERINE SLICE.The husband takes a slice of tangerine; the movement is slow, deliberate, and carries "physical weight."

Location: The stone wall at deep twilight.

Style: 3D animation with a "hand-keyed" feel; avoiding the smoothness of motion capture.

Aesthetics: Warm, amber-toned lighting; glistening but stylized fruit textures; deeply emotional "acting" through subtle eye movements.


create image, aspect ratio as per uploaded image - The Finale: The Horizon
Subject: The elderly indian couple as two soft-edged silhouettes leaning against each other,Sitting on a mossy stone wall and watching the horizon;  weight-based 3D animation.

Composition: An extreme wide crane shot that slowly rises and pulls back, revealing the vastness of the ocean and the sun disappearing.

Action: They remain still, watching the horizon; the light reflects off the leaves in painterly dabs.

Location: A cliffside orchard overlooking a vast, stylized sea with rolling, low-poly waves.

Style: High-art 3D production; minimalist environment but rich, layered lighting.

Aesthetics: Vibrant "Flow-style" sunset with deep purples and fiery magentas; majestic and peaceful; fading slowly into a soft-focus blur.

Negative Prompt: (Photorealistic, 2D flat anime, high contrast, sharp black outlines, shiny plastic materials, generic big-studio 3D look, motion blur artifacts, messy brushstrokes, text, watermark, dialogue bubbles).
